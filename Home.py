    Machines are critical to all business nowadays, and we expect them to operate at peak level for long time. 
    Normally, we can use corrective maintenance strategy to make the best use of machines. 
    But we could end up costing even higher due to downtime and labor. 
         
    Preventive maintenance comes in to reduce unplanned failures while businesses try to address problem in advance. 
    However, the costs could still be high. By using predictive maintenance, we can prevent those unexpected problems more efficiently. 
    We can fix the machines just in time as we monitor and predict the status of them.
        
    Failure prediction is a major topic in predictive maintenance in many industries. 
    Airlines are particularly interested in predicting equipments failures in advance 
    so that they can enhance operations and reduce flight delays.
